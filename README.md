## This is a project to access FB accounts using selenium in python
### INSTRUCTIONS
    Use the command line of your system
    Run the following command
```shell
    python fb1.py
```
    Enjoy the program!!
### NOTE
    Only login, and logout has been started.
    There is a lot of error-handling to be written.
    There seems to be a problem with the new version of selenium.
    Selenium is unable to load the profile. This is the exact error message.
```shell
    selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: Can't load the profile.
```
    The code in the repo is currently NOT in working condition. Pull Requests to fix this issue are most welcome.
